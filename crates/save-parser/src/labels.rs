//! Declarative field-label schema for the save tree.
//!
//! This is the *naming* counterpart to the typed extraction in [`crate::model`]:
//! the same key→meaning knowledge that `from_tree` uses imperatively, exposed as
//! data so tools (the save editor's tree navigator and, later, its structured
//! sections) can label raw fields without maintaining a parallel map.
//!
//! Each [`BlockSchema`] describes one block of same-shaped data — a list whose
//! elements share a struct shape (pets, equipment, creations, …) or a single
//! keyed struct (Baal-Slayer parts). Keys are relative to the element and may be
//! dotted for nested structs (e.g. a pet's `w.d.b` is its class level).
//!
//! Fields and elements can carry a [`Resolve`] hint: an id that the editor turns
//! into a human name (monument id → "Mighty Statue", class id → "Mage", an
//! equipment instance id → the item it points at). A block's `element_name` says
//! how to title each element (a pet by its name, a monument by its id).
//!
//! **Keep this in step with `model.rs`:** when you identify a new field there,
//! add a line here. The save-editor coverage test checks every key resolves on a
//! real save (so a key that exists *nowhere* is caught), and a single entry
//! labels every element of the block. It cannot catch a typo that happens to
//! land on another real key in the same struct — for that, cross-check the key
//! letters against `from_tree` in `model.rs`.
