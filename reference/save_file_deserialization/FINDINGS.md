# ITRTG Save File Format — Findings

Working notes for deserializing a full ITRTG save. Started 2026-06-09 from
`ManualSave_2026-06-09.txt` plus same-session in-game exports (Pet Stats, Main
Stats, Pet Equips, Dungeon Teams, Next Ats) used as ground truth for
cross-referencing.

Regenerate the expanded tree at any time:

```powershell
.\expand_save.ps1            # writes save_expanded.txt (+ save_layer1.txt, decompressed.bin)
```

## Container format (outer → inner)

1. The save file is base64 text **with 2 extra characters prepended** (here
   `V2`). Strip the first 2 characters before decoding. (Purpose unknown —
   possibly a version tag or junk salt. Worth checking against a second save.)
2. Base64-decode. Result: `[0..3]` little-endian `int32` = uncompressed length
   (here 292,296), `[4..]` = a standard **gzip** stream.
3. Gunzip → ASCII text which is itself **base64 again**.
4. Base64-decode → "layer 1" plaintext: a serialized object tree (see grammar).

So: `strip2(b64( len_le32 ++ gzip( b64( tree ) ) ))`.

## Serialization grammar

- A **struct** is `key:value;key:value;...`.
- Keys are single/double letters in declaration order `a..z` then `A..Z`;
  fields added in later game versions use zero-padded numeric keys
  (`001:`, `002:`, … `041:`).
- A key with **no colon and no value** (e.g. `...;c;d:1;`) is an empty field.
- **Nested structs are base64-encoded** and stored as the value.
- **Lists** are `&`-joined base64 elements (each element usually a struct).
- Numbers: invariant-culture ints/doubles, scientific notation (`7.3E+185`).
  Booleans: `True`/`False`.
- In some prose/log strings `:` is escaped as `(` (e.g. the server-time log in
  the root `006` field).

## Top-level map (root struct)

| key | meaning | evidence |

`K`,`O`,`P`,`Q`,`S`,`T`,`V` blocks, etc.)

## `X` — pet system

| key | meaning | evidence |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `b` | list of 158 pets | count matches Pet Stats export exactly, same order |
| `c` | Puny Food count | 123,548 = inventory transcription exact (2nd save) |
| `d` | Strong Food count | 16,276 ✓ exact |
| `e` | Mighty Food count | 7,239 ✓ exact |
| `v` | Chocolate count | 9,989 ✓ exact (was the "10062 unknown" in save 1) |
| `002` | **gem inventory**: list of {`a`=element id, `b`=gem level, `c`=count} | all 7 stacks match the transcription exactly; same element ids as pets (0=N,1=F,2=W,3=E,4=Wi) |
| `x` | list of 8 **campaign slots** | `d` = `&`-joined pet ids (10 per slot), `e` = 43,200,000 ms = 12 h, `f` = total bonus, `c` = timestamp, `i` = RNG seed |
| `y` | pet stones | 267,028 ✓ Main Stats |

| `Q` | list of 69 — **material inventory** (`a`=item id, `b`=count) | export-confirmed: 117=Ant 192,164 ✓, 159=Strategy Book 2,840 ✓, 166=Honey 787 ✓, 174=Acorn 24,727 ✓. Full id→name table (incl. the prior project's identifications: Herb/Iron Ore/…/Soul of Sylph) lives in `crates/save-parser/src/items.rs` |
| `R` | list of 209 — **owned pet equipment** | see equipment struct |
| `S` | list of 3 — **dungeon teams** | `a` = 6 pet ids (`&`-joined, matched via pet `k`), `b` = dungeon id, `c` = pending loot (item id+count), `d` = depth, `i` = dungeon name ("Scrapyard", "Water Temp", "Forest") |
| `T` | list of 23 | ? (per-entry: id-ish `a`, float `c`, nested gear-like `g`) |
| `Z` | a saved 6-pet team preset | `a` = pet ids, `h` = slot order |
| `028` | list of 737 (id + 2 flags) | ? possibly catalog unlock flags |

## Pet struct (`X.b[i]`)

Confirmed against Salamander / Gnome / Sylph / Vampire and the whole dungeon
team roster:

| key | meaning | evidence |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `a` | display name (see name mapping below) | |
| `g` | **normal level** (resets at rebirth) | matches displayed level exactly for all 7 pets checked 2026-06-10 |
| `j` | **current normal Health** (= 10 × Physical; recomputed live) | Gnome j ↔ displayed Health 36.885e9 / Physical 3.688e9; moved ~+30% between the two saves (Anni Cake accumulation) |
| `o`,`p`,`q`,`r` | **training-clone stats** (Physical/Mystic/Battle/HP) — a snapshot from when training was last configured | ratios exactly match the user's global per-mille settings (1/556/550) and the HP=10×Physical rule; bit-identical across both saves while `j` moved |
| `h` | level/exp-state related (likely normal-level exp counter) | identical for same-level pets; static across saves while no pet was training |
| `k` | **internal pet type id** — the id used by team/campaign lists | team ids resolve: 89=Salamander, 25=Rudolph, 2=Cat, 0=Mouse, 803=Serow |
| `l` | unlocked flag | locked pets `False` ✓ export Unlocked column |
| `m` | timer ms: 86,400,000 (locked) / 34,976,500 (all unlocked pets) | shared countdown — next growth tick? |
| `v` | **dungeon team slot** (1–6, 0 = none) | matches all 18 team members ✓ |
| `w` | dungeon sub-struct, see below | |
| `E` | **growth** (float; exports round it). Stored *without* the Magic Egg ×1.3 — true base growth. | 66841.359… → "66,841" ✓ for every pet; Pandora's box `E` = 44334.321043064, the exact base the Magic Egg validation derived (export shows 57,635 = ×1.3 rounded) |
| `F` | **partner pet type id** (999 = none) | 158/158 match export Partner column; pairs are mutual (Cat↔Dog, Vampire↔Succubus, Gnome↔Dwarf) |
| `G` | partner-related counter (bond level?) | only nonzero when F≠999 |
| `H` | ? (only Cat: 10,920) | |
| `d`,`e`,`f`,`n`,`s`,`t`,`u`,`x`,`y`,`z`,`A`–`D` | ? | t: Vampire=1, Dog=4, Penguin=7; y: Gnome=14, Salamander=19, Sylph=24 |

For the normal-stats formula work (display-side model, the Anni Cake
multiplier, open staircase questions), see `normal_stats_investigation.md`.

### Pet dungeon sub-struct (`w`)

| key | meaning | evidence |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `a` | element: 0=Neutral, 1=Fire, 2=Water, 3=Earth, 4=Wind | matches export Element for all checked |
| `b` | dungeon level | Salamander 101 ✓, Sylph 117 ✓ |
| `c` | dungeon exp | |
| `d` | class struct: `a`=class id, `b`=class level, `c`=class exp | Salamander Supporter 24 ✓, Sylph Mage 24 ✓ |
| `e`,`f`,`g` | weapon / armor / accessory **equip instance id** (0 = none) | 704/766/787 = Pet Equips export `Salamander=704,766,787` ✓ |

### Class ids (from pairing all 158 pets with the export, zero conflicts)

0=None, 1=Blacksmith, 2=Alchemist, 3=Adventurer, 4=Defender, 5=Supporter,
6=Rogue, 7=Assassin, 8=Mage.

## Equipment struct (`X.R[i]`)

Example: instance 704 = "Inferno Sword + 10, SSS, Wind gem lv 10":

| key | meaning | evidence |
|-----|---------|----------|
| `a` | item type id (21 = Inferno Sword, 51 = Magic Stick, 47 = …) | |
| `b` | plus level (+10/+20/+13); stat multiplier = 1 + 0.05×plus | ✓ export + wiki scaling rule |
| `c` | quality: A=5 baseline, ±1/step (8=SSS, 7=SS, 6=S, 5=A, 4=B verified; 3=C, 2=D inferred); stat multiplier = 1 + (c−5)×0.1 | ✓ export + wiki ("C +8 ⇒ 0.8 × 1.4"; "SSS +20 ⇒ 1.3 × 2.0 = 2.6") |
| `d`, `h` | instance id (both equal in every entry checked) | referenced by pet `w.e/f/g` and Pet Equips export |
| `e` | 20 when export shows "(20)" suffix, else 0 | awakening/max-plus cap? |
| `f` | gem level (10) | ✓ |
| `g` | gem element (4 = Wind gem, same element ids) | ✓ |
| `i` | 0 always so far | ? |

## Save name → export name mapping

The save stores the pet's *display name*; exports normalize. Differences found
(index = position in both lists):

```
Pandora's box → Pandora        Thunder Ball → Raiju        Young Basilisk → Basilisk
Pixie Goatmother → PixieGoat   Feather Pile → Owl          Seed → Yggdrasil
Supreme Taco → StaleTortilla   Flying Cloud → Cloud        Fire Fox → Firefox
Chicken → Egg                  Answer → Question           Hermit Crab → Crab
Pigñata → Pignata              Rudolph → Reindeer          Tödlicher Löffel → Spoon
Vesuvius → Volcano             Treasure → Mimic            Black Hole Chan → BHC
Holy ITRTG Book → Book         V. Pheasant → VermilionPheasant
Baby Carno → Carno             Gray1 → GrayChild1          Gray2 → GrayChild2
Dark Gift → Baphomate
```

Plus all multi-word names have spaces stripped in exports (`Ancient Mimic` →
`AncientMimic`, `Mist Sphere` → `MistSphere`, …). Note `Pigñata` has a real
`ñ` in the save (UTF-8).

## Cross-reference checks that passed

- Growth (`E`) matches Pet Stats export for every pet (export rounds).
- All three equip slots match Pet Equips export ids exactly.
- Dungeon teams: membership (`S[].a` ↔ pet `k`), slots (pet `v`), dungeon
  names, depths — all match the Dungeon Teams export.
- GP, GP spent, total might, crystal power, pet stones, strategy books, ants,
  acorns all found at expected values.

## Open questions / next steps

- Pet fields `d,e,f,g,h,j,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,x,y,z,A–D,H` — meaning unknown.
  `g/h/j/o/p/q/r` presumably the stat-bonus / total-exp accumulators behind the
  computed HP/Attack/etc. shown in exports (those stats are *not* stored).
- HP/Attack/Defense/Speed/elemental affinities from the Pet Stats export do
  not appear literally in the save → derived at runtime. If we ever need them,
  we either keep using the export or reverse the formulas.
- `X.v` (10,062), `X.z` (13,253,888), `X.T` (23 entries), `X.028` (737 ids),
  pet `t`/`u` — unidentified.
- Material id ↔ name: mostly solved in `crates/save-parser/src/items.rs`
  (prior-project table + export-confirmed + the 2026-06-10 full inventory
  transcription: 16/17 = Health Potion X/S, 19 = Antidote — correcting the
  prior table's "Nothing"; real Nothing is 119 — and 21 = Torch).
  Remaining: the five count-1 ids {130,160,164,167,168} ↔ {Not Nothing,
  Absolutely Nothing, Aether Ring +28, Food Journal One, Food Journal Two}
  (set known, assignment unknown), and the T4 materials 131–135 ↔
  {Mythril, Ocean/Sun/Sky/Jungle Stone} (all still count 32 in both saves —
  needs the counts to diverge, e.g. after crafting with one of them).
- Equipment *type* id ↔ name: solved for everything equipped — 32 types in
  `items.rs::equipment_type_name`, derived by joining Pet Stats gear strings
  ↔ Pet Equips instance ids ↔ the save's `R` instance→type map (zero vote
  conflicts), plus Storm Bow via its unique count. Remaining: the nine
  unequipped 1-count types {5,8,22,23,26,30,41,52,56} ↔ {Iron Pot, Water
  Spear, Flood Spear, Leeching Sword, Tree Axe, Hurricane Bow, Flame Armor,
  Flood Armor, Tree Bracelet}, and 44 = {Magic Hammer | Storm Ring} —
  equipping any of them once would resolve it.
- The 2 leading junk chars: constant? random? Compare with another save.
- Re-serialization (writing a save) untested — only needed if we ever want to
  edit saves, which is out of scope for the planner.
- Token/evolution state (export "Other" column: GnomeFinal, SylphFinal, fight
  counts, day counters) — not yet located in the pet struct (candidates: the
  unknown `t`,`u`,`x`,`y`,`z`,`A–D`,`H` fields).

## Rust parser

`crates/save-parser` implements all of this: `container` (outer layers),
`tree` (generic grammar → `Node`), `model` (typed `SaveFile` with pets,
equipment, materials, teams, campaigns; unknown fields stay reachable via the
raw `Node`s). Its `tests/real_save.rs` cross-checks the reference save against
the exports — when a field meaning gets identified, promote it from the raw
tree into the typed model there. `cargo run -p save-parser --bin save-dump --
<save> [--tree]` replaces `expand_save.ps1` for exploration.

## Files here

- `ManualSave_2026-06-09.txt` — first raw save (input).
- `* Export.txt` — same-session in-game exports (ground truth).
- `second_save/` — 2026-06-10 save + re-exports + **full manual inventory
  transcription** (materials, gems, equipment counts) — the richest ground
  truth so far.
- `normal_stats_investigation.md` — the normal-stats formula work.
- `expand_save.ps1` — decoder/expander script (superseded by
  `save-dump --tree` but kept for history).
- `save_layer1.txt`, `decompressed.bin`, `save_expanded.txt` — derived
  artifacts (regenerable; the expanded tree is the one to read).
